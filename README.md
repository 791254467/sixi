# Sixi Robot Arm

Sixi is an open source industrial robot arm.

## Motivation

3D printers can print parts for themselves, but they cannot self-assemble.  The long goal of the Sixi is to build a machine that can assemble copies of itself.

When 3D printers were closed source, they started at $10k.  Makerbot and Prusa changed the game by bringing high quality open source 3D printers down to $2k.  Marginally Clever Robots, Ltd. aims to be the Prusa of robot arms.

## Links and Info

Sixi was designed in Fusion 360.  The design is publicly shared...

Marginally Clever uses our home made Robot Overlord app to simulate, drive, and test the Sixi robot arm.

Marginally Clever uses Makelangelo Firmware in the Arduino compatible brain of the robot.
